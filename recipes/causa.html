    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Also known as Peruvian Causa Rellena (rellena meaning filled in English), Causa de Pollo is a simple, satisfying starter dish similar to causa de atún, the more common version of this yummy, creamy dish.</p>
    <p>Mashed potatoes with mayonnaise, avocados and limes give this dish a fresh flavor. Add in ají amarillo, the famous yellow pepper from Peru, and you’ve got a side dish that shines. It’s the perfect starter or large snack and the recipe is easy to make. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups yellow potatoes</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken</li>
        <li>¾ cups mayonnaise 150 g.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons black olives</li>
        <li>½ cup peas 75 g.</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup onion 60 g.</li>
        <li>3 yellow peppers ají amarillo, 1/8 cup, 40 g.</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ avocado 200 g.</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the potatoes with plenty of water and peel with a vegetable peeler. Cut them into four or six parts according to their size. You should get pieces of (at most) 5 cm.</li>
        <li>Place them in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water and a teaspoon of salt. Cook half covered for at least 15 minutes until potatoes are soft. The way to test them is to prick them with a fork. If your fork meets little resistance, they are soft enough to puree.</li>
        <li>Strain the potatoes, let them drain for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>The best Causa Limeña meat is chicken breast. A small chicken breast gives around 300 grams of shredded chicken. Roast or boil the chicken according to your taste. Remember to add a pinch of salt and a little pepper for cooking.</li>
        <li>Peel the onion and chop finely.</li>
        <li>Boil the egg in plenty of water, and remove the shell. Cut it into thin slices.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are still warm, place them in a large bowl, and with a potato masher, mash them until there are no lumps left.</li>
        <li>Wash the chili peppers and place them on a cutting board. Remove the stem with a sharp knife, cut crosswise and remove all the veins and seeds. Cut the chili peppers into large pieces. Don’t worry about size because they will liquefy later.</li>
        <li>Put the oil and peppers into the blender glass. Beat for about three minutes. The mixture will not be completely homogeneous.</li>
        <li>Pour the chili sauce over the mashed potatoes with a pinch of salt and mash again for a few minutes until the chili is fully blended into potatoes. Taste and if necessary, rectify with salt.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl place the shredded chicken. Make sure that all the chicken is finely chopped. Add mayonnaise, chopped onion, lime juice, and peas. Stir until all ingredients are well mixed.</li>
        <li>Remove the seed from the avocado, peel the skin away and cut the soft flesh into thin slices. Sprinkle a few drops of lime over the avocado slices to prevent it from turning brown.</li>
        <li>For the next step, the assembly of the causa rellena, use an empty can with the base and lid removed (using a can opener). If you wish, you can use a round mold or a square mold or even a glass container.</li>
        <li>Place the can on a flat plate and add two tablespoons of mashed potatoes. With a spoon or any other utensil that you consider convenient, press the mashed potatoes towards the bottom of the plate and flatten.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of avocado pieces.</li>
        <li>Then add three tablespoons of chicken with mayonnaise. Press down gently.</li>
        <li>Cover with a second layer of mashed potatoes and flatten once more. Very carefully remove the can by pulling it upwards. Repeat this procedure until you run out of ingredients. We make 6 Causas Limeñas with the ingredients listed above.</li>
        <li>On top of each Causa Limeña place an egg slice, a few black olives and some thin slices of yellow chili.</li>
        <li>Serve individually as a starter for dinner or a cold appetizer for lunch.</li>
